# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing board creation form by transforming it from a single-step process into a multi-step wizard. The multi-step approach will provide a more guided and organized experience for users creating boards, allowing them to configure different aspects of their board in logical stages. This will improve user experience by breaking down the board creation process into manageable steps and enabling more advanced configuration options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating a board, I want to provide basic information about the board in the first step, so that I can establish the fundamental details before moving to more specific configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the board creation form THEN the system SHALL display a multi-step wizard starting with step 1
2. WHEN the user is on step 1 THEN the system SHALL display fields for board type selection, recipient name, and name type
3. WHEN the user selects a board type THEN the system SHALL validate the selection and enable progression to the next step
4. WHEN the user enters a recipient name THEN the system SHALL validate the name format and length
5. WHEN the user selects a name type THEN the system SHALL store this preference for later use in board display
6. WHEN all required fields in step 1 are valid THEN the system SHALL enable the "Next" button
7. WHEN the user clicks "Next" from step 1 THEN the system SHALL save the step 1 data and navigate to step 2

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user creating a board, I want to configure type-specific settings in the second step, so that I can customize the board behavior based on the selected board type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user reaches step 2 THEN the system SHALL display configuration options specific to the board type selected in step 1
2. WHEN the board type is "appreciation" THEN the system SHALL display appreciation-specific configuration options
3. WHEN the board type is "birthday" THEN the system SHALL display birthday-specific configuration options
4. WHEN the board type is "farewell" THEN the system SHALL display farewell-specific configuration options
5. WHEN the user modifies type-specific settings THEN the system SHALL validate the changes in real-time
6. WHEN all required type-specific fields are valid THEN the system SHALL enable the "Next" button
7. WHEN the user clicks "Back" from step 2 THEN the system SHALL return to step 1 with previously entered data preserved
8. WHEN the user clicks "Next" from step 2 THEN the system SHALL save the step 2 data and navigate to step 3

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user creating a board, I want to configure board-specific settings in the final step, so that I can control how posts are managed and displayed on my board.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user reaches step 3 THEN the system SHALL display board-specific configuration options
2. WHEN the user selects "single post" mode THEN the system SHALL configure the board to allow only one post per contributor
3. WHEN the user selects "multi post" mode THEN the system SHALL configure the board to allow multiple posts per contributor
4. WHEN the user modifies board-specific settings THEN the system SHALL validate the changes in real-time
5. WHEN all required board-specific fields are valid THEN the system SHALL enable the "Create Board" button
6. WHEN the user clicks "Back" from step 3 THEN the system SHALL return to step 2 with previously entered data preserved
7. WHEN the user clicks "Create Board" THEN the system SHALL validate all steps and create the board with the configured settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user navigating the multi-step form, I want to see my progress and be able to navigate between steps, so that I can understand where I am in the process and make changes if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on any step THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing current step and total steps
2. WHEN the user is on step 2 or 3 THEN the system SHALL display a "Back" button to return to the previous step
3. WHEN the user clicks "Back" THEN the system SHALL preserve all entered data and navigate to the previous step
4. WHEN the user navigates between steps THEN the system SHALL maintain form validation state for each step
5. WHEN the user returns to a previously completed step THEN the system SHALL display the previously entered values
6. WHEN the user is on the final step THEN the system SHALL display a summary of all selected options
7. WHEN there are validation errors on any step THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation to the next step until resolved

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user creating a board, I want the form to handle errors gracefully across all steps, so that I can understand and resolve any issues without losing my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur on any step THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages specific to the invalid fields
2. WHEN the user attempts to navigate to the next step with invalid data THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation and highlight the errors
3. WHEN server errors occur during board creation THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow the user to retry
4. WHEN the user encounters an error THEN the system SHALL preserve all entered data across all steps
5. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and retry options
6. WHEN the user refreshes the page during form completion THEN the system SHALL preserve the current step and entered data where possible
